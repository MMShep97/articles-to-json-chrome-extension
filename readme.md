Chrome extension to save a list of articles that have ever impacted you (negatively or positively) in json format...

 - click and drop it into the extension which proceeds to ask you a questionairre of sorts -- can also leave notes about how it impacted you...
 - like stated above, that data will then be ingested and output it in json...
 - having it easily accessible in json notation allows other developers to use that data however they see fit 
^Or in that similar vein - create an api to digest information of that sort... (
